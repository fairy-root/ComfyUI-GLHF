## Features

### Versatile Model Support

Interact with a range of language models to suit diverse use cases. Configure models via the `config.json` file for flexibility and control over model selection.

### Integrated Web Search

Enhance your prompts with real-time information by enabling web search. The node:

- Retrieves relevant search results.
- Extracts content from URLs included in the prompts.
- Appends this information to the input for more contextual and accurate outputs.

Here are examples of the web search feature in action:
